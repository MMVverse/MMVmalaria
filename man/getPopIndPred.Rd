\usage{
getPopIndPred(
  modelFolder,
  timeGrid = "obsTimes",
  abs0inputs = NULL,
  abs0Tk0param = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelFolder}{String denoting path to IQRnlmeProject. If
IQRnlmeProjectMulti is provided, the first element will be used}

\item{timeGrid}{Default: 'obsTimes'}

\item{abs0inputs}{numeric vector with numbers of inputs (ADM) that are of type
ABSORPTION0. If this argument is set also abs0Tk0param needs to be defined. Default: NULL}

\item{abs0Tk0param}{character vector with names of regression parameters that
should be used as 0-order infusion time (by updating TINF). The regression
parameters for these values are kept in the event table. Ordering has to be as in abs0inputs. Default: NULL}
}
\value{
data.frame containing simulation results
}
\description{
From an IQRnlme project folder, build event tables with either
population (POP) or individual (IND) parameters, run simulations with  both and return
POP predictions (\code{XPRED}) and IND predictions (\code{IPRED}) for every subject
