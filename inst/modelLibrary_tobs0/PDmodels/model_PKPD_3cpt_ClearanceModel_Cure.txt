********** MODEL NOTES
Library model for malaria PKPD modeling.

PK  No of Compartments:   3 (Vc, Vp1, Q1, Vp2 & Q2)
    Elimination:          Linear (CL) & Non-Linear (VMAX & KM)
    Absorption:           1st order absorption (Fabs1 & ka)

PD	Dynamic:        Once a drug had an effect on the parasite the parasite enter a
                    "zombie" state before dying. A zombie state is a state where the
                    parasite is in between death and life but is counted as being
                    alive. This zombie stage is introduced to explain why the killing
                    rate in vitro (in vitro PRR) is larger that the Emax estimated
                    from SCID mouse experiments. In this model, the Emax is assumed to
                    be the same than in the in Vitro PRR which allows to estimate the
                    clearance rate of the parasite and have a higer EC50 than in the
                    Emax-Model.
    Transformation: ONLY FOR THE OUTPUT - Logarithmic (P=parasitemia -> PL=log(P)
                    where log is the natural logarithm)
    Growth:         Linear (GR)
    Drug Effect:    Hill Function depending on the concentration at the central
                    compartment Cc (EMAX, EC50 & hill)
    Baseline:       Taken as PLbase + GR*Tobs0 where PLbase is the baseline
                    parasitemia at time of first dose. GR is the linear parasite
                    growth rate and Tobs0 is the time of the first observation
                    relative to the time of the first dose, i.e. Tobs0 = time of
                    first observation - time of first dose.

Important assumption: INPUT dose and PK model matched to lead to drug
                      concentration in ug/mL!

Units of parasitemia assumed in percent or 1/mL (both log-transformed: ln not
log10).


********** MODEL STATES

# PK model (dosing: INPUT1)
d/dt(Ad)  = -ka*Ad + factorUnits*Fabs1*INPUT1
d/dt(Ac)  =  ka*Ad - Q1/Vc*Ac + Q1/Vp1*Ap1 - Q2/Vc*Ac + Q2/Vp2*Ap2 - CL/Vc*Ac - VMAX*Cc/(KM+Cc)
d/dt(Ap1) =          Q1/Vc*Ac - Q1/Vp1*Ap1
d/dt(Ap2) =          						 Q2/Vc*Ac - Q2/Vp2*Ap2

# Parasitemia PD model (log transformed parasitemia)
d/dt(PLtot) = (GR*Fcure+CLPara)*exp(PLliv-PLtot) - CLPara
d/dt(PLliv) = (GR - EMAX*Eff - Cure)*Fcure
PLtot(0)    = PLbase + GR*Tobs0
PLliv(0)    = PLbase + GR*Tobs0
