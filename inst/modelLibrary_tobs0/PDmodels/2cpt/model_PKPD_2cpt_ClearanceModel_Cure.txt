********** MODEL NOTES
Library model for malaria PKPD modeling.

PK	No of Compartments:	2 (Vc, Vp1, Q1)
	Elimination:		Linear (CL) & Non-Linear (VMAX & KM)
	Absorption:			1st order absorption (Fabs1 & ka)

PD	Dynamic:            Once a drug had an effect on the parasite the parasite enter a "zombie" state before dying.
                        A zombie state is a state where the parasite is in between death and life but is counted as being alive.
						This zombie stage is introduced to explain why the killing rate in vitro (in vitro PRR) is larger that
						the Emax estimated from SCID mouse experiments. In this model, the Emax is assumed to be the same than in
						the in Vitro PRR which allows to estimate the clearance rate of the parasite and have a higer EC50 than in the Emax-Model.
    Transformation:		ONLY FOR THE OUTPUT - Logarithmic (P=parasitemia -> PL=log(P) where log is the natural logarithm)
	Growth:				Linear (GR)
	Drug Effect:		Hill Function depending on the concentration at the central compartment Cc (EMAX, EC50 & hill)
	Baseline:			Taken as PLbase + PLerr where PLbase is fixed at the initial measured value and PLerr follows
						a centered gaussian, i.e. N(0,sigma^2) to allow some flexibility

Important assumption: INPUT dose and PK model matched to lead to drug
                      concentration in µg/mL!

Units of parasitemia assumed in percent or 1/mL (both log-transformed: ln not log10).


********** MODEL STATES

# PK model (dosing: INPUT1)
d/dt(Ad)  = -ka*Ad + factorUnits*Fabs1*INPUT1
d/dt(Ac)  =  ka*Ad - Q1/Vc*Ac + Q1/Vp1*Ap1 - CL/Vc*Ac - VMAX*Cc/(KM+Cc)
d/dt(Ap1) =          Q1/Vc*Ac - Q1/Vp1*Ap1

# Parasitemia PD model (log transformed parasitemia)
d/dt(PLtot) = (GR*Fcure+CLPara)*exp(PLliv-PLtot) - CLPara
d/dt(PLliv) = (GR - EMAX*Eff - Cure)*Fcure
PLtot(0)    = PLbase + PLerr
PLliv(0)    = PLbase + PLerr

********** MODEL VARIABLES

# -------- PK --------
# Drug concentration (µg/mL)
Cc = Ac/Vc            # Compound concentration (µg/mL)


# -------- PD --------
# Cure Rate
#Cure = CureMAX*exp(Hcure*PLcure)/(exp(Hcure*PLcure) + exp(Hcure*PLliv)*(CureMAX/GR-1))
#  		with CureMAX=(1+mu)*GR & Hcure=Hcure
Cure  = (1+mu)*GR*exp(Hcure*PLcure)/(exp(Hcure*PLcure) + exp(Hcure*PLliv)*mu)
