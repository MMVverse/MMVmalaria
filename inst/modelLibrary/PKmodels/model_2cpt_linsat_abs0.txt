********** MODEL NAME
model_2cpt_linsat_abs0

********** MODEL NOTES

PK model for simulation of drug concentration in central compartment
with following characteristics:
Compartments:  2
Elimination :  linear+saturable
Absorption  :  zero order (with lag time)

Unit convention
Dose: mg
Concentration: ug/mL
Time: hours

The annotation of the parameter units is consistent with the given unit convention.
Units of the inputs (dose) and outputs (concentration) in the dataset for parameter estimation need to match the unit convention.

********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(Ac) 	=  - Q1/Vc*Ac + Q1/Vp1*Ap1 - CL/Vc*Ac - VMAX*Cc/(KM+Cc) + Fabs0*INPUT1
d/dt(Ap1) 	=  + Q1/Vc*Ac - Q1/Vp1*Ap1

Ac(0)    	= 0
Ap1(0)    	= 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

Fabs0    	= 1   # Relative bioavailability (-)
CL 			  = 3 	# Apparent clearance (L/hour)
VMAX      = 3 	# Maximum apparent clearance rate (mg/hour)
KM 			  = 1  	# Michaelis-Menton constant (ug/mL)
Vc 			  = 32 	# Apparent central volume (L)
Q1			  = 1 	# Apparent intercompartmental clearance (L/hour)
Vp1			  = 10 	# Apparent peripheral volume (L)
Tk0       = 1   # Absorption time (hours)
Tlag1     = 0   # Absorption lag time (hours)

********** MODEL VARIABLES

% Calculation of concentration in central compartment
Cc 			  = Ac/Vc

% Defining an output (only needed when interfacing with NLME
% parameter estimation tools such as NONMEM and MONOLIX)
OUTPUT1  	  = Cc  # Compound concentration (ug/mL)
