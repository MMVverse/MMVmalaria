********** MODEL NAME
model_LogisticGrowth

********** MODEL NOTES
Library model for malaria PKPD modeling.

Model to describe the growth a the parasite in blood.

Growth              Logistic Growth growth model with a maximum capacity Pmax and a growth rate GR.
Transformation 		Logarithmic (P=parasitemia -> PL=log(P) where log is the natural logarithm)
Output 				PL, i.e. the logarithm of the parasitemia.
Baseline 			Taken as PLbase + PLerr where PLbase is fixed at the initial measured value and
					PLerr follows a centered Gaussian, i.e. N(0,sigma^2) to allow some flexibility.
Unit                As in the dataset, prior transformation; i.e. p/mL or percent


********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(PL) = GR*(1-exp(PL-PLmax)) + INPUT1
PL(0)    = PLbase + PLerr


********** MODEL PARAMETERS

PLbase = 0           # Observed log-transformed parasitemia at t=0 (or starting time used for the analysis). (log(percent) or log(p/mL))
PLerr  = 0   	     # Standard deviation of log-transformed baseline parasitemia

GR     = 0.05        # Parasite growth rate constant (1/hr)
Pmax   = 10          # Maximum parasite level (percent)

   
********** MODEL VARIABLES

# log-transform maximum parasitemia:
PLmax   = log(Pmax)

# -------- Output --------
OUTPUT1 = PL              # Log-transformed visible parasite count (log(percent) or log(p/mL))
