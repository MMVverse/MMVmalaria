********** MODEL NAME
model_LinGrowth

********** MODEL NOTES
Exponential growth model
Parasites modeled in log scale and assumed in p/mL or percent.

********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(DD)   = 0 + INPUT1
d/dt(PL)   = GR
PL(0)      = PLbase + PLerr

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

PLbase      = 10          # Observed log-transformed parasitemia at t=0 (or starting time used for the analysis). (p/mL or percent)
PLerr       = 0   	      # Standard deviation of log-transformed baseline parasitemia

GR          = 0.05        # Parasite growth rate constant (1/hr)


********** MODEL VARIABLES

OUTPUT1 = PL              # Log-transformed visible parasite count (p/mL or percent)
