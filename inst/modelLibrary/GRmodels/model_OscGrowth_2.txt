model_OscGrowth_2

********** MODEL NOTES
Library model for malaria PKPD modeling.

Model to describe the growth a the parasite in blood.

Growth              Exponential growth model with oscillation of the growth rate GR.
Oscillation 		The  growth rate oscillate around it mean value GR, with an ampliture Amp,
					a period Plen and a phase 2*PI*Dtime/Plen (when time=Dtime the growth rate is GR).
Transformation 		Logarithmic (P=parasitemia -> PL=log(P) where log is the natural logarithm)
Output 				PL, i.e. the logarithm of the parasitemia.
Baseline 			Taken as PLbase + PLerr where PLbase is fixed at the initial measured value and
					PLerr follows a centered Gaussian, i.e. N(0,sigma^2) to allow some flexibility.
Unit                As in the dataset, prior transformation; i.e. p/mL or percent


********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(PL) = GR + 2*Pie/Plen*Amp*sin(2*Pie*(time-Dtime)/Plen) + INPUT1
PL(0)    = PLbase + PLerr


********** MODEL PARAMETERS

PLbase = 0           # Observed log-transformed parasitemia at t=0 (or starting time used for the analysis). (p/mL)
PLerr  = 0   		 # Standard deviation of log-transformed baseline parasitemia

GR     = 0.05        # Parasite growth rate constant (1/hr)

Amp    = 0.5         # Amplitude of oscillation (-)
Plen   = 48          # Period length of oscillation (hours)
Dtime  = 0           # Time shift of osciallation (GR at time = Dtime)
